# CONCEPT SCREENS
This is for the first moment a brainstorming

- WELCOME SCREEN-
  - Should include a button that direct the customer to a High Score Screen
  - Should include a button that start's a new game, or resume a paused game
  - Should include a button that direct us to the setting screen

 - GAMING SCREEN-
  - Should display the current Score
  - Should display the lokal High Score
  - Could have a Top lane with the username
  - MUST have a tax cross to move the shapes, also must have a left/right rotation button
  - Should display the next shape in the 
  - Should show the current level/speed

- SETTING SCREEN-
  - Should allow to mute the game
  - Should allow to regulate the SFX/Musik
  - Should allow to delete the local high score
  - Should allow to change the username
   - Maybe can save multiple Users - makes a switch between different players possible
  - Different types of difficulties

- HIGH SCORE SCREEN-
 - Should display at least top 10 scores on this device
 - If we have a online database about player score, there should be a option that shows us at least World/Region Top10, and our own     position with at least 4 positions above/behind us
