# Tetris

This flutter project is a student project at Bfz-Kassel GmbH.

## What is this project about?

A Android / Flutter / Dart adaptation of the classic game concept of Tetris.

## What is the app about? What do we want to achieve?

I usually think that developing anything game-like is rather frustrating. First
of all, games are harder to develop in terms of graphics and sound. Even a
small-scale project like a Tetris clone that is ready for the App Store will
need hundreds of hours on graphical details. That's why some big companies are
dominating the market. If you did one "Candy Crush" clone, it is easy to develop
the next one, because the buildung blocks (how does a diamond look like) will
not change very much, can be resused in dozens of games and so on. Plus,
developing these graphic assets is not part of the profession "Fachinformatik"
and therefore of no benefit at all to our students.

Buuuuut .... some students liked the idea and I accepted the challenge to make a
decent Tetris clone, without any ambitions to make it more beautiful than a game
you can download for free in the app store. Plus, Tetris is quite a nice option to
talk about object oriented design because it is truly a game of objects ("falling
from the sky, consisting of other objects, stopping to move when hitting an object
and so on).

## What is the current state of the app?

Zero. Niente. Nada. Nichts.

## What do we have to do in this phase of the project?

The advantage of a project like Tetris is that almost everybody already knows
how it should look and what it can do. We will have to discuss mainly the main
layout and then we should start discussing classes and how to make them and why.
And this is probably the most interesting phase of this project.

## How can I contribute?

Understand the project and contribute, first just by discussing the direction
in which this project should be developed. Then we can start with "issues", which
means concrete ideas of what to do (code related and not). And soon contributions
may shift towards VSCode and actual code.
